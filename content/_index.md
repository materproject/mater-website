# Science-based open agricultural tools

**Mater** was created with the goal of developing and sharing **farming and gardening methods** grounded in **scientific principles** and the **smart application of technology**.
We would like Mater to be a space where everybody can **learn and better understand** topics such as **agriculture, food, ecology, biology, technology, environmental science, sociology, economics, history**.
We believe in free knowledge, that's why all of our projects are completely ***open source*** and available to anyone.
